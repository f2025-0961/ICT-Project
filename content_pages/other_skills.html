            <h3>a.No-Code Development & Website Building?</h3>
            <p><strong>No-code development</strong> and <strong>website building</strong> is the process of creating

                These platforms provide ready-made templates and components such as forms, buttons, and images, making
                development faster and simpler. No-code tools allow non-technical users to build functional websites
                without developer support.</p>
            <p> They help reduce development time and cost while enabling quick updates and changes. Many platforms also
                support e-commerce, animations, and integrations. However, customization and advanced functionality may
                be limited compared to coded solutions. No-code development is best suited for small businesses,

            <h3>Whay is SEO:?</h3>
            <p><strong>SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</strong> is the process of improving a website so that it
                appears higher in search engine results like Google, Bing, or Yahoo when people search for related

                relevant, useful, and trustworthy for both users and search engines. SEO involves using the right
                keywords, creating quality content, optimizing website structure and speed, and building backlinks from
                other reliable websites. When SEO is done properly, it helps a website gain better visibility, attract

            <h2>8. Prompt Engineering</h2>
            <h3>a.What is Prompt Engineering?</h3>
            <p>Prompt engineering is the skill of designing clear, specific, and well-structured instructions (called
                prompts) to get accurate, useful, and high-quality responses from artificial intelligence models such as
                ChatGPT. It involves choosing the right words, context, format, and constraints so the AI understands
                exactly what is required. Good prompt engineering helps improve output quality, reduces errors, saves
                time, and makes AI more effective for tasks like writing, coding, data analysis, learning, and problem
                solving. It is an important skill in the field of artificial intelligence because better prompts lead to
                better results, even without changing the AI model itself.</p>
