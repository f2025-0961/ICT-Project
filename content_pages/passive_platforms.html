        <h1>Passive Income Platforms</h1>

        <p>
            Passive income platforms allow individuals to earn money continuously by creating digital assets,
            promoting products, or monetizing content. Unlike active income, passive income focuses on scalability
            and long-term sustainability rather than hourly work.
            <br><br>
            These platforms require initial effort, patience, and ethical practices. Once established,
            they can generate income with minimal daily involvement. Below are globally trusted passive
            income platforms explained in detail.

            <h2>1. Amazon Associates</h2>

            <h3>What is Amazon Associates?</h3>
            <p>
                Amazon Associates is the official affiliate marketing program by Amazon. It allows users to earn
                commissions by promoting Amazon products through blogs, websites, YouTube channels, or social media.
                Affiliates generate unique referral links and earn when visitors purchase products through them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to Amazon’s global reputation, product variety, and strong buyer trust, conversion rates are
                higher compared to many other affiliate programs. Affiliates are not responsible for inventory,
                delivery, or customer support.
            </p>

            <h3>Who Can Use Amazon Associates?</h3>
            <ul id="list_css">
                <li>Bloggers and niche website owners</li>
                <li>YouTube content creators and reviewers</li>
                <li>Social media influencers (policy-compliant)</li>
                <li>Beginners learning affiliate marketing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>
                After registration and approval, affiliates place product links inside content. When a visitor
                clicks the link and purchases any product during the session, the affiliate earns a commission.
                Earnings depend on product category and order value.
            </p>

            <h3>Income Reality</h3>
            <p>
                Beginners typically earn $10–$100 per month. With SEO-focused content and authority websites,
                earnings can grow to $1,000–$5,000 per month. Large niche sites may exceed $10,000 monthly.
            </p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <ul id="list_css">
                <li>Low commission rates</li>
                <li>Short cookie duration</li>
                <li>Strict compliance policies</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong>Success Tip:</strong> Focus on helpful, honest reviews instead of aggressive promotion.
