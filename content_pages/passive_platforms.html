        <h1>Passive Income Platforms</h1>

        <p>
            Passive income platforms allow individuals to generate recurring or long-term income by building
            digital assets, promoting products, or monetizing content. These platforms typically require
            upfront effort, strategic planning, and consistency, but offer income potential with reduced
            day-to-day involvement once established.
            <br><br>
            Unlike active freelancing, passive income relies on scalability and automation.
            The platforms listed below are widely trusted, transparent, and aligned with ethical earning practices.
        </p>
