        <h1>Scam Awareness & Online Fraud Prevention</h1>

        <p>
            With the rapid growth of online earning opportunities, online scams and digital frauds have also increased.
            Many people—especially beginners—fall victim to fake platforms, misleading offers, and fraudulent links.
            <br><br>
            This page is created to educate users about the most common online scams, how they operate, and how to
            protect yourself while earning online.
            <br><br>
            <b>Important Note:</b> If something promises fast, guaranteed, or effortless money — it is almost always a
            scam.
        </p>

        <br>

        <!-- Section 1 -->
        <h2>1. Fake Online Earning Platforms</h2>
        <p>
            Fake platforms pretend to offer jobs, freelancing, or investment opportunities but disappear after
            collecting money or personal information.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Require upfront registration or “activation” fees</li>
            <li>No verifiable company address or legal registration</li>
            <li>Fake testimonials and screenshots</li>
            <li>No clear payment system or support</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Reality:</b> Legitimate platforms never charge users just to start working.
        </p>

        <br>

        <!-- Section 2 -->
        <h2>2. Get-Rich-Quick Schemes</h2>
        <p>
            These scams promise extremely high income in a very short time with little or no effort.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>“Earn $500 per day without skills”</li>
            <li>“Guaranteed income within 24 hours”</li>
            <li>“Secret system they don’t want you to know”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Reality:</b> Online earning requires time, learning, or effort. There are no shortcuts.
        </p>

        <br>

        <!-- Section 3 -->
        <h2>3. Fake Job Offers & Employment Scams</h2>
        <p>
            Scammers impersonate companies and offer fake jobs via email, WhatsApp, Telegram, or social media.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Ask for registration fees or security deposits</li>
            <li>Offer jobs without interviews or skill checks</li>
            <li>Use non-official email domains</li>
            <li>Pressure users to act quickly</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Reality:</b> Real employers never ask candidates to pay to get hired.
        </p>

        <br>

        <!-- Section 4 -->
        <h2>4. Phishing Links & Fake Websites</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing scams use fake links or websites to steal login credentials, personal data, or financial details.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Links that look similar to real websites (example: amaz0n.com)</li>
            <li>Urgent messages claiming account suspension</li>
            <li>Requests to verify passwords or payment details</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Safety Tip:</b> Always check the website URL carefully before entering any information.
        </p>

        <br>

        <!-- Section 5 -->
        <h2>5. Investment & Crypto Scams</h2>
        <p>
            Fraudulent investment schemes often promote fake trading platforms, crypto coins, or mining apps.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Guaranteed profit claims</li>
            <li>Fake dashboards showing fake earnings</li>
            <li>Withdrawal blocked unless more money is added</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Reality:</b> Real investments always involve risk. Guaranteed profits do not exist.
        </p>

        <br>

        <!-- Section 6 -->
        <h2>6. Referral & Pyramid Schemes</h2>
        <p>
            These schemes focus on recruiting others rather than providing real products or services.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Income depends mainly on referrals</li>
            <li>No real service or value provided</li>
            <li>Collapse when recruitment stops</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Reality:</b> Sustainable income is built on real skills, products, or services.
        </p>

        <br>

        <!-- Section 7 -->
        <h2>7. Fake Social Media Gurus & Influencer Scams</h2>
        <p>
            Some influencers sell fake courses or mentorship programs claiming extraordinary results.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Luxury lifestyle marketing without proof</li>
            <li>No transparent curriculum</li>
            <li>Paid reviews and fake success stories</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Advice:</b> Verify credentials, reviews, and learning value before purchasing any course.
        </p>

        <br>

        <!-- Section 8 -->
        <h2>How to Stay Safe Online</h2>

            <li>Never pay upfront for online jobs</li>
            <li>Verify platforms through official websites</li>
            <li>Avoid pressure-based decisions</li>
            <li>Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication</li>
